## About

*Rewilding Mathematics* aims to draw on multidisciplinary expertise to investigate opportunities for mathematics to contribute to rewilding efforts.

We are a group of academics and professionals, predominantly though not exclusively based in the United Kingdom, with a range of backgrounds in research united by the common thread of mathematics.
<!-- You can find out more about us on the [people](people.html) page. -->

We have been supported by the [International Centre for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.icms.org.uk/) through the [Mathematics for Humanity](https://www.icms.org.uk/funding-opportunities/mathematics-humanity) programme.

## Outputs

We held a series of [seminars](seminars.html) during the Winter and Spring of 2024, which culminated in a week-long [workshop](news/workshop_june_2024.html) in June centred around the question: *how can mathematics help with rewilding?* 

We intend to publish the results of this workshop in the coming months.

## Enquiries

We are keen to increase the breadth of expertise and diversity of experience in our working group.
